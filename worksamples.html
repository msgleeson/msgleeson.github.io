            <h2>Stage 6 Industrial Technology - Multimedia</h2>
            <h3>HSC Major project</h3>
            <p>Below are two examples of Major Projects produced by students studying the <strong> HSC Industrial Technology - Multimedia </strong> course. </p>
            <p>Both students achieved a Band 6 for this course in the HSC. </p>
            <h4>Obsessed</h4>
                <iframe width="680" height="383" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tsmoIiu9RZc?si=9YmDhaHqDO6VgYv8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p><strong>"OBSESSED"</strong> is a music video to a self produced piece of music that addresses a loss of viewership and engagement with videos within the music industry. This student's Major Project was awarded 60/60 (full marks).</p>
            <h4>Damnation</h4>
                <div class="embed-video">
                    <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lV-DXSP_s" target="_blank"><img src="images/Damnation-stills.png" width="680"></a></p>
                </div>
            <p><strong>"DAMNATION"</strong> is a thought-provoking Sci-Fi short film that delves into the final moments of an astronaut as he plummets towards an unknown planet. These fleeting seconds become a profound vessel, allowing him to reflect on and appreciate the entirety of his life experiences. This project is a synthesis of philosophical musings and intense visual storytelling, aiming to immerse the viewer in the astronaut's journey of introspection.</p>    
            <h3>Management Folio</h3>
            <p>All students must produce a Management Folio that documents their production process for the HSC Industrial Technology Major Project.</p>
            <p>While it is not possible to provide copies of the Management Folios for these students due to copyright and privacy reasons, both students used the following document as a guide to design and print their Management Folio document for marking: <a href="docs/ITMM_HSC_Folio_Printing_Guidelines.pdf">ITMM HSC Folio Printing Guidelines.pdf</a></p>
