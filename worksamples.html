            <p>Below are two examples of Major Projects produced by students studying the <strong> Industrial Technology - Multimedia </strong> course. </p>
            <p>Both students achieved a Band 6 for this course in the HSC. </p>
            <h2>Obsessed</h2>

            </div>
            <p><strong>"OBSESSED"</strong> is a music video to a self produced piece of music that addresses a loss of viewership and engagement with videos within the music industry. This student's Major Project was awarded 60/60 (full marks).</p>
            <h2>Damnation</h2>
            <div class="sample-photo">
                <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6lV-DXSP_s" target="_blank"><img src="images/damnation-stills.png"></a></p>
            </div>
            <p><strong>"DAMNATION"</strong> is a thought-provoking Sci-Fi short film that delves into the final moments of an astronaut as he plummets towards an unknown planet. These fleeting seconds become a profound vessel, allowing him to reflect on and appreciate the entirety of his life experiences. This project is a synthesis of philosophical musings and intense visual storytelling, aiming to immerse the viewer in the astronaut's journey of introspection.</p>
