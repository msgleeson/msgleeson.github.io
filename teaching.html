        <section>
            <p>I believe in creating inclusive, future-focused learning environments that empower students to develop both technical proficiency and critical thinking.</p>
            <p>My teaching is grounded in authenticity, accessibility, and equity â€“ I design experiences that reflect real-world industry practices while supporting a diverse range of learners, including those traditionally underrepresented in STEM. </p>
            <p>I strive to foster student agency by integrating project-based learning, tangible computing, and creative expression, ensuring students see themselves as capable designers, problem-solvers, and contributors to the digital world. </p>
            <p></p>Whether teaching HTML, CSS and JavaScript, multimedia production, or quantum programming, I encourage iterative learning to build confidence and capability.</p>

            <h2>My Teaching Philosophy</h2>
            <img src="images/Teacher-Quote.png" alt="visual teaching quote - 'Education is not the filling of a pail but the lighting of a fire' - William Bulter Yeats" width="250px">
            <p>Central to my philosophy is a commitment to social justice and the belief that education should not only equip students with skills, but also empower them to shape a more ethical and sustainable future. </p>
            <p>I intentionally incorporate culturally responsive pedagogy, accessibility considerations, and environmental awareness into curriculum design. </p>
            <p>I also seek to model lifelong learning by collaborating with industry partners, engaging with research, and continuously refining my own practice. </p>
            <p>My goal is for students to leave my classroom not only with knowledge, but with curiosity, purpose, and a strong sense of possibility.</p>
